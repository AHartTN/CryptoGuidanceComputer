## Project Overview
This is a React TypeScript application that mimics the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) DSKY (Display and Keyboard) interface for displaying cryptocurrency prices. The application integrates with Web3 technologies and uses a verb-noun command system similar to the original Apollo DSKY.

## Key Features
- Apollo DSKY-inspired UI with authentic styling
- Verb entry system (using Verb 12 for crypto price requests)
- Real-time cryptocurrency price fetching
- Web3 integration for blockchain data
- Monospace fonts and retro computer aesthetic
- Seven-segment display styling for numbers

## Code Style Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Follow React functional component patterns with hooks
- Use styled-components for CSS-in-JS styling
- Implement responsive design principles
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Follow accessibility best practices

## Component Structure
- Keep components small and focused
- Use custom hooks for shared logic
- Implement proper error handling
- Use TypeScript interfaces for props and state
- Follow the atomic design methodology

## Styling Guidelines
- Use a retro green monospace color scheme (#00FF00 on dark background)
- Implement seven-segment display fonts for numbers
- Use CSS Grid and Flexbox for layouts
- Maintain the authentic Apollo computer aesthetic
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

## API Integration
- Use Axios for HTTP requests
- Implement proper error handling and loading states
- Use environment variables for API keys
- Cache API responses appropriately
- Handle rate limiting gracefully
